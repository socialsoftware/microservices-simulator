# Quizzes — Domain Model

> Follows the structure defined in [`docs/templates/domain-model-template.md`](../../docs/templates/domain-model-template.md).

**How to use this file:**
1. Read §1–§2 to understand the entities, their attributes, and how they relate.
2. Read §3 to understand every consistency rule and its predicate.
3. See [`quizzes-aggregate-grouping.md`](quizzes-full-aggregate-grouping.md) for the concrete aggregate partitioning decision and its event-dependency consequences.

## §1 — Entities

Each entity lists only its own scalar attributes. Cross-entity references appear in §2. The **Owns** column lists value objects that live inside this entity's boundary and have no independent identity (they are created and deleted with the entity).

> **Soft-delete:** Every aggregate inherits `state: AggregateState` from the simulator `Aggregate` base class (values: `ACTIVE`, `INACTIVE`, `DELETED`). This field is **not** a domain attribute and must **not** appear in the entity table. It is set by `remove()` on the base class. Rules that predicate on deletion (e.g. `X.state == DELETED`) rely on this field.

| Entity | Attributes | Owns |
|---|---|---|
| **Course** | `name: String` (immutable), `type: CourseType (TECNICO \| EXTERNAL)` (immutable) | — |
| **User** | `name: String`, `username: String`, `role: Role (STUDENT \| TEACHER \| ADMIN)` (immutable), `active: Boolean` (default: false) | — |
| **Topic** | `name: String` | — |
| **Execution** | `acronym: String`, `academicTerm: String`, `endDate: LocalDateTime` | — |
| **Question** | `title: String`, `content: String`, `creationDate: LocalDateTime` | Option × N |
| **Option** | `sequence: Integer`, `optionKey: Integer`, `content: String`, `correct: Boolean` | — |
| **Quiz** | `title: String`, `creationDate: LocalDateTime` (immutable), `availableDate: LocalDateTime`, `conclusionDate: LocalDateTime`, `resultsDate: LocalDateTime`, `quizType: QuizType (EXAM \| TEST \| GENERATED \| PROPOSED \| IN_CLASS \| EXTERNAL_QUIZ)`, `lastModifiedTime: LocalDateTime` (technical) | — |
| **QuizAnswer** | `creationDate: LocalDateTime` (immutable), `answerDate: LocalDateTime` (immutable), `completed: Boolean` | QuestionAnswer × N |
| **QuestionAnswer** | `optionSequenceChoice: Integer`, `optionKey: Integer`, `correct: Boolean`, `timeTaken: Integer` | — |
| **Tournament** | `startTime: LocalDateTime`, `endTime: LocalDateTime`, `numberOfQuestions: Integer`, `cancelled: Boolean`, `lastModifiedTime: LocalDateTime` (technical) | `TournamentParticipant × N` |
| **TournamentParticipant** | `participantAggregateId: Integer`, `participantName: String`, `participantUsername: String`, `participantVersion: Long`, `enrollTime: LocalDateTime` | `TournamentParticipantQuizAnswer × 1` |
| **TournamentParticipantQuizAnswer** | `quizAnswerAggregateId: Integer`, `quizAnswerVersion: Long`, `answered: Boolean` (default: false), `numberOfAnswered: Integer` (default: 0), `numberOfCorrect: Integer` (default: 0), `firstAnswerTime: LocalDateTime` (technical, default: null) | — |

> **Technical field note:** `lastModifiedTime` on `Quiz` and `Tournament`, and `firstAnswerTime` on `TournamentParticipantQuizAnswer`, are not domain attributes. They are stamped at mutation time so that `verifyInvariants()` can check temporal constraints (e.g., "fields are final after `availableDate`", "answer was linked after `startTime`") without calling `now()` inside the invariant, which would make it non-deterministic across TCC merges. `firstAnswerTime` is set once (idempotent) when `quizAnswerAggregateId` is first linked via `linkQuizAnswer()`.

## §2 — Relationships

The direction is always from the referencing entity to the referenced entity. **Immutable** means the reference is set at creation and never changed.

| From | To | Cardinality | Immutable |
|---|---|---|---|
| Topic | Course | N → 1 | yes |
| Execution | Course | N → 1 | yes |
| Execution | User (students) | N → M | no (students enroll and leave) |
| Question | Course | N → 1 | yes |
| Question | Topic | N → M | no (topics can be updated) |
| Quiz | Execution | N → 1 | yes |
| Quiz | Question | N → M | no (frozen after `availableDate`) |
| QuizAnswer | Quiz | N → 1 | yes |
| QuizAnswer | User/student | N → 1 | yes |
| QuizAnswer | Execution | N → 1 | yes |
| QuestionAnswer | Question | N → 1 | yes |
| Tournament | Execution | N → 1 | yes |
| Tournament | User/creator | N → 1 | yes |
| Tournament | User/participants | N → M | no (participants enroll and leave) |
| Tournament | Topic | N → M | no (frozen after `startTime`) |
| Tournament | Quiz | 1 → 1 | yes |
| Tournament | QuizAnswer (per participant) | N → M | no (updated as answers arrive) |

## §3 — Rules

### 3.1 — Single-entity rules

These rules inspect only fields of a single entity.

| Rule | Entity | Predicate |
|---|---|---|
| COURSE_TYPE_FINAL | Course | `Course.type` is immutable (Java `final` field) |
| COURSE_NAME_FINAL | Course | `Course.name` is immutable (Java `final` field) |
| USER_ROLE_FINAL | User | `User.role` is immutable (Java `final` field) |
| USER_DELETED_STATE | User | `User.state == DELETED ⟹ User.active == false` |
| QUIZ_CREATION_DATE_FINAL | Quiz | `Quiz.creationDate` is immutable (Java `final` field) |
| QUIZ_DATE_ORDERING | Quiz | `creationDate < availableDate < conclusionDate ≤ resultsDate` |
| QUIZ_FIELDS_FINAL_AFTER_AVAILABLE_DATE | Quiz | `Quiz.lastModifiedTime > prev.availableDate ⟹ availableDate, conclusionDate, resultsDate, questions are unchanged from prev` |
| TOURNAMENT_START_BEFORE_END_TIME | Tournament | `Tournament.startTime < Tournament.endTime` |
| TOURNAMENT_UNIQUE_AS_PARTICIPANT | Tournament | All entries in `Tournament.participants` have distinct user IDs |
| TOURNAMENT_ENROLL_UNTIL_START_TIME | Tournament | `∀p ∈ Tournament.participants: p.enrollTime < Tournament.startTime` |
| TOURNAMENT_FINAL_AFTER_START | Tournament | `Tournament.lastModifiedTime > prev.startTime ⟹ startTime, endTime, numberOfQuestions, topics, cancelled are unchanged from prev` |
| TOURNAMENT_IS_CANCELED | Tournament | `prev.cancelled == true ⟹ startTime, endTime, numberOfQuestions, topics, cancelled, participants are unchanged from prev` |
| TOURNAMENT_DELETE | Tournament | `Tournament.state == DELETED ⟹ Tournament.participants.isEmpty()` |
| TOURNAMENT_CREATOR_PARTICIPANT_CONSISTENCY | Tournament | `∀p ∈ participants where p.userId == creator.userId: p.name == creator.name ∧ p.username == creator.username ∧ p.version == creator.version` |
| TOURNAMENT_ANSWER_BEFORE_START | Tournament | `∀p ∈ participants: p.quizAnswer.firstAnswerTime != null → p.quizAnswer.firstAnswerTime ≥ startTime` |

> **Immutability fields:** `TOURNAMENT_CREATOR_IS_FINAL`, `TOURNAMENT_COURSE_EXECUTION_IS_FINAL`, `TOURNAMENT_QUIZ_IS_FINAL`, `QUIZ_COURSE_EXECUTION_FINAL`, `QUIZANSWER_FINAL_USER`, `QUIZANSWER_FINAL_QUIZ`, `QUIZANSWER_FINAL_COURSE_EXECUTION`, `QUIZANSWER_FINAL_CREATION_DATE` are all enforced by Java `final` fields or by absence of setters after construction. No `verifyInvariants()` check is needed.

> later by a different mechanism. No counters, count commands, or `Course.verifyInvariants()` logic
> currently enforce it.
