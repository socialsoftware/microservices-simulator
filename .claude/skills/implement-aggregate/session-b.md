# Session 2.N.b — Write Functionalities

This sub-file is loaded by `implement-aggregate` when the target session type is `b`. All context variables (`{app-name}`, `{pkg}`, `{AppClass}`, `{Aggregate}`, `{N}`, `{src}`, `{test}`, `{bean-config}`) are already available from the router.

---

## Reads

Load these files before writing any code:

1. **Domain files produced in session 2.{N}.a** — read every file listed in the plan.md `2.{N}.a` row for this aggregate. You need the aggregate class structure, field names, constructor signature, and `SagaState` enum values.

2. **`docs/concepts/service.md`** — specifically:
   - § Method Patterns (Read / Create / Mutate / Mutate with event publication / Mutate with optional sub-collection parameter)
   - § Copy-on-Write Rule, § DTO Immutability (R7), § Exception-Throw Convention
   - § P3 Guard Placement — where own-table uniqueness checks and DTO field validation live
   - § Partial-Data Owned Entities (only if the aggregate has owned sub-entities)
   - § Custom Repository — Latest-Active-Version Query (only if returning lists)

3. **`docs/concepts/commands.md`** — specifically:
   - § What a Command Is, § Naming Conventions, § File Location
   - § ServiceMapping Enum (mandatory entry per aggregate)
   - § Sending Commands (Functionality Layer), § Routing Commands (CommandHandler)
   - § Known DTO Gaps and Compensating Command Steps (only if the saga touches a known-gap DTO; see subsection list)

4. **`docs/concepts/sagas.md`** — specifically:
   - § Step Ordering (authoritative; this session no longer restates it)
   - § Lock-Acquisition Step Pattern (Two-Step Write Sagas), § Semantic Locks in Practice
   - § R4 Decision Table — `SagaCommand` vs `setForbiddenStates`
   - § Write Workflow Structure

5. **`docs/concepts/testing.md`** — § T3 — Functionality Test (and § T2 — Service-Command Test if this aggregate exposes any). Note:
   - What a T3 test asserts (state after the operation, events emitted, P3 guard violations, not-found, step-interleaving) — P1 predicate tests are not part of T3
   - How to test P3 guard violations
   - How to test P4a prerequisite failures (e.g., sending a command that causes the saga fetch to fail)
   - **Semantic-lock-acquisition rule:** one lock-acquisition case per saga step that calls `setSemanticLock`; use `executeUntilStep`, assert the expected `IN_{OP}` saga state, then `resumeWorkflow` and `noExceptionThrown()`. Cross-aggregate `setForbiddenStates` conflict validation is **deferred — see Appendix — Cross-Functionality Test** in `docs/concepts/testing.md`.
   - § Fake / Wrong / Weak Detection Checklist — apply before committing the test file

6. ***(Conditional)*** If the plan.md aggregate section lists cross-aggregate prerequisites (P4a or P3 DTO-check rules): read the service file and relevant command files of each upstream aggregate involved. You need their command class names, service method signatures, and what they throw on failure.

## Produce

Produce every file listed in the plan.md `2.{N}.b` row. The authoritative file list is in plan.md — use it exactly. The descriptions below explain what each file must contain.

> **Prerequisite — ServiceMapping**: Verify that `{src}{AppClass}/ServiceMapping.java` exists and contains an entry for `{AGGREGATE}`. If not, create it (or add the missing entry) before writing any commands — every command constructor references `ServiceMapping.{AGGREGATE}.getServiceName()`.
>
> **Multi-word aggregate naming:** The value must equal `resolveServiceName(SagaXxx)`, which strips "Saga" from the aggregate's simple class name and lowercases the first character. For multi-word aggregates this is camelCase — e.g. `SagaQuizAnswer` → `"quizAnswer"`. Never use a shortened alias; mismatches cause silent bean-lookup failures that only appear at commit/abort time.

> **Prerequisite — `Get{Aggregate}ByIdCommand`**: If `Get{Aggregate}ByIdCommand` does not yet exist (it may be planned for session-c), create it now. Write sagas that use a get-then-lock step require this read command in session-b. Also add `get{Aggregate}ById` to `{Aggregate}Service` (if not yet present) and a handler case for `Get{Aggregate}ByIdCommand` in `{Aggregate}CommandHandler` — missing either will cause a compile error even when the command class exists.
>
> **Recording this in plan.md:** After creating `Get{Aggregate}ByIdCommand` here, add a note in plan.md under the session-b row (or as a separate inline comment) stating that the command was already created in session-b. This prevents session-c from creating a duplicate when it encounters the command in the session-c file list.

> **Prerequisite — Upstream count-manipulation commands**: If any saga for this aggregate sends an `Increment{Xxx}CountCommand` or `Decrement{Xxx}CountCommand` to an upstream aggregate's `CommandHandler`, verify that handler already routes the command. If the case is missing, add it before running tests — an unrouted command silently does nothing and will cause invariant violations or state corruption that are difficult to diagnose after the fact.

### `{Aggregate}Service.java` (write methods)

Path: `{src}microservices/{aggregate}/service/{Aggregate}Service.java`

- Spring `@Service`
- One method per write functionality listed in plan.md
- Method signature: receives the command's fields + `UnitOfWork unitOfWork`
- **P3 own-table uniqueness guards** (if listed in plan.md P3 rules): query the repository for duplicates before creating; throw `{AppClass}Exception` with the appropriate error message constant if found
- **P3 DTO field checks** (if listed in plan.md cross-aggregate prerequisites): receive the saga-assembled DTO as a parameter; validate the field; throw `{AppClass}Exception` on violation
- After validation: fetch the target aggregate via `{Aggregate}CustomRepositorySagas`, mutate its fields via setters, call `verifyInvariants()`, then `unitOfWork.registerChanged(aggregate)`
- **Soft-delete** (`remove()`): use copy-on-write — load the aggregate, create a factory copy via `factory.create{Aggregate}Copy(old)`, call `copy.remove()`, then `registerChanged(copy)`. Never call `remove()` on the managed entity returned by `aggregateLoadAndRegisterRead`; doing so lets JPA auto-flush the deleted state before the saga abort query runs, making the aggregate invisible to the abort path.
- **Event publishing**: for each event this aggregate publishes (see plan.md Events published), call `unitOfWork.registerEvent(new {Event}(...))` at the end of the relevant service method

> **Deferred P3 guards:** If a P3 DTO-check rule listed in plan.md cross-aggregate prerequisites requires data from an aggregate ordered _after_ this one in plan.md (because that later aggregate subscribes to this one's events), the guard cannot be implemented yet. Do the following:
> 1. **Skip** the data-assembly saga step and the service guard — do not add stubs.
> 2. Add a `// TODO: {RULE_NAME} — deferred; requires {LaterAggregate}Dto, available after session 2.{M}.b` comment in the `{Op}FunctionalitySagas` class at the exact location where the data-assembly step will be inserted.
> 3. Flag the deferral explicitly in the session retro.
> 4. When session 2.{M}.b completes, revisit this saga and add the data-assembly step and service guard.
>
> This situation arises when there is a bidirectional dependency between two aggregates: the topological sort correctly prioritizes the event-subscription direction, and the P3 read-time reverse dependency is the deferred consequence. The plan.md for such rules should carry a ⚠️ DEFERRED marker (added by classify-and-plan) — if you see it, this guidance applies.

### `{Aggregate}CommandHandler.java`

Path: `{src}microservices/{aggregate}/messaging/{Aggregate}CommandHandler.java`

- Spring `@Component`
- One `@CommandHandler` method per command class produced in this session
- Each handler: creates a `UnitOfWork`, calls the matching service method, commits the `UnitOfWork`, returns result
- Routes each command to the corresponding service method

### One `{Op}{Aggregate}Command.java` per write functionality

Path: `commands/{aggregate}/{Op}{Aggregate}Command.java`

- Implements `Command`
- Fields: all parameters needed by the service method
- Constructor, getters
- Name convention: operation in PascalCase + aggregate name + `Command` (e.g., `CreateTournamentCommand`)

### One `{Op}FunctionalitySagas.java` per write functionality

Path: `{src}microservices/{aggregate}/coordination/sagas/{Op}FunctionalitySagas.java`

- Extends `FunctionalitySagas` (or the appropriate saga base class from the simulator core)
- Steps are defined as `SagaStep` instances in the constructor or `defineSteps()` method
- **Step ordering, lock-step pattern, R4 foreign-vs-primary distinction, R8 upstream-only rule, and compensation pairing** — follow `docs/concepts/sagas.md` § Step Ordering (and the linked § Lock-Acquisition Step Pattern, § R4 Decision Table). That section is authoritative; do not re-derive the order from the implementation.
- The **conditional validate-dates step** is per-aggregate guidance, not a generic pattern: if `plan.md` for this aggregate lists time-based invariants on both this aggregate and a downstream aggregate created in the same saga, insert the validate-dates step first.

### `{Aggregate}Functionalities.java`

Path: `{src}microservices/{aggregate}/coordination/functionalities/{Aggregate}Functionalities.java`

- Spring `@Service`
- One public method per write functionality (matching the saga class name)
- Each method:
  1. Derives `functionalityName` via `new Throwable().getStackTrace()[0].getMethodName()`
  2. Creates a `SagaUnitOfWork` with `unitOfWorkService.createUnitOfWork(functionalityName)`
  3. Instantiates the corresponding `{Op}FunctionalitySagas` directly (not as a Spring bean)
  4. Calls `executeWorkflow(uow)` on it
  5. Returns the result DTO (or `void` for mutations)
- Tests `@Autowired` this class and call its methods directly

### One `{Op}Test.groovy` per write functionality (T3)

Path: `{test}sagas/coordination/{aggregate}/{Op}Test.groovy`

> **Anti-pattern:** Do not read `{Aggregate}Service.java` or `{Op}FunctionalitySagas.java` to decide what to assert. Tests derived from the implementation you just wrote are tautological — they verify what the code does, not what the domain says it should do. The remedy is the spec table below.

**Cite plan.md as the spec — do not author a parallel artifact.** The `plan.md` aggregate section for the target aggregate already contains the happy-path postconditions, the events-published list, and the P1/P3 rule list. That section *is* the spec; the test asserts it. See `docs/concepts/testing.md` § Spec-First Ordering.

At the top of every happy-path and violation test, write a single-line `// Spec:` comment that names the plan.md section and the rule (or "happy path") the test asserts. Example:

```groovy
def "updateQuestionContent: QUESTION_CONTENT_REQUIRED violation"() {
    // Spec: plan.md §3.5 Question / functionalities — UpdateQuestionContent; rule QUESTION_CONTENT_REQUIRED
    given:
    ...
}
```

If the implementation disagrees with the cited section, flag it as an impl deviation — do not adjust the cited rule to match.

**Kill-mutation check (after writing each happy-path test):** Ask "if `unitOfWork.registerChanged(aggregate)` were removed from the service, would my test still pass?" If yes, the test does not verify persistence. Add an assertion on a field the operation changes that is only readable through the persisted aggregate (i.e. the `then:` reads back via `get{Aggregate}ById`, not from a local variable).

- Extends `{AppClass}SpockTest`
- **Happy-path test**: set up prerequisites using `{AppClass}SpockTest` helpers, execute the operation, assert all fields from the spec table above
- **P3 guard tests**: test each P3 rule violation (own-table duplicate, DTO field check)
- **P4a prerequisite tests**: test what happens when the upstream fetch fails (e.g., creator not enrolled in execution)
- **Assertion for all violation tests:** `thrown({AppClass}Exception)` plus `ex.message == {RULE_NAME}`. Never use `thrown(Exception)` — the bare `Exception` is only acceptable in Fault / Behavior Test (Appendix) fault-injection tests. Never accept a bare `thrown({AppClass}Exception)` without the message assertion — it passes on any thrown exception of that type, including unrelated bugs. The `{RULE_NAME}` constant must match the name in `plan.md`'s rule list, not be inferred from the implementation.
- **P1 intra-invariants are not tested here** — they belong in `{Aggregate}IntraInvariantTest.groovy` (session a). Do not add P1 violation tests or BVA boundary straddles to T3 service tests.
- **Semantic-lock acquisition (required):** Follow `docs/concepts/testing.md` § T3 — Semantic-lock-acquisition rule. **One lock-acquisition case per saga step that calls `setSemanticLock` — no exceptions:**
  - **`setSemanticLock` step:** run the workflow through the lock step via `executeUntilStep("<lockStep>", uow)`, assert `sagaStateOf(<id>) == <Aggregate>SagaState.IN_<OP>` in `expect:`, call `resumeWorkflow(uow)` in `when:`, assert `noExceptionThrown()` in `then:`.
  - Cross-aggregate `setForbiddenStates` conflict validation is **deferred — see Appendix — Cross-Functionality Test** in `docs/concepts/testing.md`.
  - **Coverage is audited mechanically.** List every `setSemanticLock` step (one row per call site) in the session retro's **Semantic-Lock Coverage Audit** table — see `.claude/skills/implement-aggregate/SKILL.md` Step 7.b. Unresolved `Present? = No` rows block the Step 8 commit.
### Service-command method tests (T2)

After writing the coordinator-level T3 tests above, scan `{Aggregate}Service.java` for any
additional methods that call `registerChanged` but are **not** exposed through
`{Aggregate}Functionalities`. These are invoked via commands from other aggregates' sagas
(e.g., `decrementExecutionCount` called when a related aggregate is deleted).

For each such method:
1. Write T2 tests (happy path + P3 guard violations; floor/ceiling for count methods) — no semantic-lock case needed (no saga steps). P1 intra-invariant violations are not tested here; they belong in `{Aggregate}IntraInvariantTest.groovy`.
2. If a mirror method is missing (e.g., `incrementExecutionCount` exists in the reference app but
   not here), add it now — it will be needed when the other aggregate's saga is implemented and
   is required for invariant-violation test setup.
3. Place the test file in `{test}sagas/{aggregate}/`, naming it
   `{OperationName}Test.groovy` or combining related operations into one file
   (e.g., `{Aggregate}CountsTest.groovy`) when they share setup.

### Event classes (if this aggregate publishes events)

For each event listed in plan.md Events published that does not yet exist:

Path: `{src}events/{Event}.java`

- Extends `pt.ulisboa.tecnico.socialsoftware.ms.aggregate.Event` from simulator core — it is a JPA `@Entity` and must be annotated `@Entity`. Do **NOT** implement `DomainEvent` directly.
- Fields: all payload fields needed by consumers (check aggregate-grouping §4 event table in domain spec for payload)
- Constructor, getters

### Error message constants

Open `{src}microservices/exception/{AppClass}ErrorMessage.java` and add constants for:
- P3 guard violations introduced in this session
- Any new invariant messages not already added in session `a`

Append to the existing file; do not remove existing constants.

### `{Aggregate}Controller.java`

Path: `{src}microservices/{aggregate}/coordination/webapi/{Aggregate}Controller.java`

- Single `@RestController` annotation; empty body
- Package: `pt.ulisboa.tecnico.socialsoftware.{pkg}.microservices.{aggregate}.coordination.webapi`
- No methods needed — REST endpoints are not exercised by the test harness; this stub marks the architectural slot
- Import: `org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController`

## Update BeanConfigurationSagas.groovy

Open `{bean-config}` and add new `@Bean` methods for:

```groovy
@Bean
{Aggregate}Service {aggregate}Service(...) {  // inject repos and other services as needed
    return new {Aggregate}Service(...)
}

@Bean
{Aggregate}CommandHandler {aggregate}CommandHandler() {
    return new {Aggregate}CommandHandler()
}

@Bean
{Aggregate}Functionalities {aggregate}Functionalities() {
    return new {Aggregate}Functionalities()
}
```

**Note:** `{Op}FunctionalitySagas` classes are **not** Spring beans — they are instantiated inline inside `{Aggregate}Functionalities`. Only the three beans above are needed per aggregate.

Add the corresponding `import` statements. Place new beans after the beans added in session `a` for this aggregate.

---

## Update `{AppClass}SpockTest.groovy`

Open `{test}{AppClass}SpockTest.groovy` and add:

1. An `@Autowired(required = false)` field for the functionalities class:
   ```groovy
   @Autowired(required = false)
   protected {Aggregate}Functionalities {aggregate}Functionalities
   ```

2. A `create{Aggregate}(...)` helper method that calls `{aggregate}Functionalities.create{Aggregate}(...)` with a minimal valid DTO and returns the resulting aggregate ID. Tests use this helper in their `setup:` block to satisfy prerequisites.

## Tick the Checkbox

In plan.md, replace:
```
- [ ] 2.{N}.b — Write functionalities
```
with:
```
- [x] 2.{N}.b — Write functionalities
```
